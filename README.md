# OffensiveLanguagePythonProject
TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS PROJECT	Spring 2022
Developed an Offensive language classification model that can be used to predict if a tweet is offensive. Conducted an error analysis by comparing the predictions to the ground truth values.

•	Predicted whether a tweet is offensive with the given .tsv files for training and test datasets using classification algorithms and various tools and packages in Python.
•	Built a supervised machine-learning model.
•	Developed features that improved the performance of the model.
•	Tested the model and conducted an error analysis.
•	Presented ideas for improving model performance in the future.
